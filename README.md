# Softphone-development
A Softphone application to implement SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) functionalities and initiated a call to an X-lite phone. Python was used to code the softphone application by making use of PJSUA libraries. Wireshark was used to analyze the call flow and understand the working of SIP protocol.

Please follow the sequence of steps in the EE284 project Softphone.mp4 video file to implement the softphone.

Assumptions:
1) Proxy server like Asterisk is already installed.
2) Softphones like x-lite is already installed in one of the systems of the network so that client app can make a call to that phone.
